## **Classification of data as malignant or benign using Decision Tree model**

The dataset is taken from the sklearn library. 
Decision Tree classification is applied to distinguish between the records. The accuracy of 93% is obtained using this model. 
In preprocessing , the dataset contains no missing values but the range of attributes have large differences. To normalise the data, use of min-max scaler is put in application.
Correlation plot is described and highly corelated attributes are obtained. The model is train on new data frame of correlated columns.
The training and test data are in the ratio of 70 to 30 ratio.
